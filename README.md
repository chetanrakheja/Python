Some of my projects made in Python (Beginners)

1 Count digits in a number
<br>
2 Find out how many times a particular digit occurs in a number
<br>
3 Display the Fibonacci series up to a max limit
<br>
4 Display first n numbers of a Fibonacci series
<br>
5 Calculate the factorial of a number n
<br>
6 Generate the first 10 even number.
<br>
7 Input 10 numbers and display the smallest and largest of them
<br>
8 Input 10 numbers and display the sum and average.
<br>
9 Input a sentence and display the longest word
<br>
10 Display all the words that are contained in a sentence. Words that come multiple times should be displayed only once.
<br>
11  Input a sentence and input a word. We have to find out how many times the word occurred in the sentence.
<br>
12 We wish to display only those words from the sentence that do not occur in a set of excluded words ( like : this, and, is, not etc.). The set of excluded words would be maintained in your code, and the sentence is input from the keyboard. We have to display all words that do not exist in this set, and we have to take care that multiple occurring words are displayed only once.
<br>
13  Display the density of each word in a long sentence. The displayed words should not exist in the set of excluded words. However to calculate the density, we would use the total number of words contained in the sentence.
<br>
14 make string from an input string with words in reverse order. "A CAT RAN" => "RAN CAT Aâ€œ
